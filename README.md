# zPump

Early-stage Node.js and Solana development environment.

## Overview

This repository will host the codebase for the zPump project, blending a Node.js backend with Solana on-chain programs. As we define architecture and features, this document will outline project goals, setup steps, and contributor guidelines.

## Getting Started

Project scaffolding and detailed instructions are forthcoming. For now, ensure you have Node.js, npm (or your preferred package manager), and the Solana CLI installed locally.
